# Filing-Bot
A discord bot that sorts photos, videos, and GIFs. 
It can add and remove tags, in addition to being able to search with those tags.

# Setup PT.1
Set up is pretty straightforward. All you have to do is create a bot in the discord web portal. Tutorial here [https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/discord.html]
Then you'll need to install python 3.8.5 which can be found here [https://www.python.org/downloads/]
After you install it, you'll have to satisfy the dependencies of the bot by installing discord and json. With the commands ``pip install discord`` & ``pip install json``

# Setup PT.2
Once you've gotten python all setup you can clone the bot and put it where you'd like. Next, you have to put your discord bot token in the ``TOKEN.txt`` file, copy the directory that the script is in and paste it into ``currentdir`` variable. While you're there you can mess with the other settings. Once you're ready to put the photos, gifs, and videos, you should make a folder called ``Items`` and put it in the same folder as the bot. After that, it should be ready and you can start the script!

# Problems
If you have any problems with the bot, message me on discord at Lemon#7512.
